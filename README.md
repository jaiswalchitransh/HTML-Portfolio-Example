# HTML-Portfolio-Example
This HTML code represents a simple portfolio webpage. The document starts with a declaration of the document type and language. The head section contains metadata such as character set and viewport settings. The body consists of a header with the name and role of the individual (Chitransh Jaiswal, Full Stack Web Developer), followed by two project sections. Each project section includes a heading with a link to a corresponding HTML file, an image related to the project, and a description. Horizontal lines (hr) separate the sections. Lastly, there are links to "Contact" and "About" pages. Overall, this code creates a basic portfolio showcasing the developer's name, role, and featured projects with associated images and links.
