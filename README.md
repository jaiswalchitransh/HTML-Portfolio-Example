# HTML-Portfolio-Example

This HTML code can create a single-page portfolio. First, the document declares its type with the relevant lanugage. Metadata such as character set and viewport settings are washed away in the head section. The body is structured in the form of a header identifying the name and the role of the person (Chitransh Jaiswal, Full Stack Web Developer) and subsequently having two project sections. The project section has a header, which includes a link to the corresponding HTML file, and an image entitled within the project and a description. The segments are divided with the help of horizontal lines (hr). Lastly, there are links to “Contact” and “About” pages. The instructions “How to interpret the table” can be also treated as a link. In general, the following code generates a simplified portfolio, featuring the developer’s name, role, and highlighted projects, providing image and link options.
