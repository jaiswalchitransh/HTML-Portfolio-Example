## Project Overview
This HTML code creates a single-page portfolio. The document declares its type and specifies the language. Metadata such as character set and viewport settings are included in the head section. The body is structured with a header identifying the name and role of the person (Chitransh Jaiswal, Full Stack Web Developer) and includes two project sections. Each project section has a header with a link to the corresponding HTML file and an image with a description. Sections are divided with horizontal lines (hr). There are also links to "Contact" and "About" pages. This code generates a simplified portfolio featuring the developer’s name, role, and highlighted projects, providing image and link options.
